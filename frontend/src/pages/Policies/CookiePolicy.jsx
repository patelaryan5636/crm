        <p>
          Cookies are small text files that are placed on your device (computer,
          tablet, or mobile) when you visit a website or use a web application.
          They are widely used to make websites and applications work efficiently
          and to provide operational and analytics information to the site owner.
        </p>
        <p>
          Cookies do not contain executable code and cannot access other
          information on your device. They are specific to the website or
          application that set them and can only be read by that origin.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition to traditional cookies, Graphura CRM also uses similar
          technologies such as{" "}
          <span className="font-semibold">sessionStorage</span> and{" "}
          <span className="font-semibold">localStorage</span> (browser storage

          Essential cookies are strictly necessary for Graphura CRM to function.
          Without these cookies, certain features — such as logging in and
          maintaining a secure session — would not work.
        </p>
        <p>
          Because these cookies are essential to the operation of the Platform,
          they cannot be disabled. By using Graphura CRM, you consent to the
          use of essential cookies.

        <p>
          Performance cookies help us understand how users interact with

        <p>
          Functional cookies enable enhanced features and personalisation within
